### 1. The "Ms. Erica" Persona Prompt
*Paste this into the chat:*
> "Based on the source document, write a 2-minute introductory script for a podcast called 'Storytime with Ms. Erica'. Ms. Erica should sound warm and inviting. She should introduce Percy and Sophie and explain why tonight's story about the Polar Picnic is special for kids who might be feeling a little nervous about something new."

### 2. The Educational Deep Dive
*Paste this into the chat:*
> "Create a 'Lesson Plan' for parents based on this story. Include an activity where kids can make their own 'Sunshine Items' to help with anxiety, and list 5 vocabulary words from the story with kid-friendly definitions."

### 3. Audio Overview (The "Viral" Feature)
*Click the 'Generate' button in the Audio Overview section (Notebook Guide):*
> This will create a conversation between two AI hosts discussing Percy's journey. It's often very high quality and feels like a real radio show discussing your story's themes.

### 4. Expansion Prompt
