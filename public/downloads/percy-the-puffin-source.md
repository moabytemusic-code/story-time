# Percy the Puffin's Polar Picnic
**A Story for Storytime with Ms. Erica**

## 1. The Source Story
In the sparkling, snowy world of the North Pole, lived a very unusual puffin named Percy. Now, most puffins love the cold ocean and the chilly wind, but Percy was a bit different. Percy loved warmth. He wore a tiny, bright yellow scarf knitted by his grandmother, and he dreamt of things he had only read about in books—like tropical flowers and sun-drenched beaches.

One morning, Percy’s best friend, Sophie the Seal, flopped onto his ice ledge with a big splash. 
"Percy! The Great Northern Lights are putting on a show tonight. We should have a picnic!"

Percy shivered, pulling his scarf tighter. "A picnic, Sophie? It’s freezing! My toes feel like ten little icicles."

Sophie laughed, her whiskers twitching. "But Percy, that’s the best part! We can make it a *Polar* Picnic. We’ll bring the warmest things we can find to the coldest place in the world."

Percy was skeptical, but he loved an adventure. They spent the whole afternoon preparing. Percy packed a thermos of Ms. Erica’s Special Spiced Cocoa (mostly because it smelled like cinnamon and hugs). Sophie brought "Sunshine Sandwiches"—which were really just salmon and kelp, but she’d cut them into the shape of stars.

When the sun began to dip below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of violet and gold, they hiked up to Glitter Peak. The wind was howling, and Percy’s knees were knocking. 

"I don't know, Sophie..." Percy whispered.

"Look up, Percy!" Sophie pointed with her flipper.

Suddenly, the sky exploded with ribbons of emerald green, neon pink, and deep indigo. The Northern Lights danced across the stars like magical silk. Percy was so mesmerized he forgot to be cold. He opened the thermos, and the steam rose up, catching the colors of the sky.

As they sat there, sipping cocoa and eating star-shaped sandwiches under the Great Lights, Percy realized something important. He didn't need a tropical beach to be warm. He had his yellow scarf, a thermos of cocoa, a dancing sky, and the best friend a puffin could ask for.

"You were right, Sophie," Percy said, his beak orange and bright in the moonlight. "The cold isn't so bad when you bring your own sunshine."
