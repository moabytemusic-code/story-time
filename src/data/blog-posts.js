            <p>We've all been there: it's 8:30 PM, the lights are off, but little eyes are wide open. The request comes: "Just one more story!" But not all stories are created equal when it comes to sleep.</p>
            
            <h3>The Science of "Sleepy Stories"</h3>
            <p>Stories that are too exciting or have high-stakes conflict (will the puppy find his bone?!) increase cortisol and adrenaline. What you need are stories that leverage <strong>narrative transportation</strong> without the adrenaline spike.</p>

            <h3>1. The "Repeat and Fade" Technique</h3>
            <p>Our story "The Sleepy Moon" uses this. Characters say goodnight to objects in a rhythmic, repetitive pattern. This mimics the brain's natural slowing down process.</p>

            <h3>2. Sensory Grounding</h3>
            <p>Look for stories that ask children to focus on physical sensations in a calm way. "Can you feel your heavy legs? Can you feel the soft pillow?" This pulls focus from the busy mind to the relaxed body.</p>

            <h3>3. "Lila & The Ocean Song"</h3>
            <p>Water sounds are naturally soothing. In this audio adventure, children sync their breathing with the waves. It's meditation disguised as a journey.</p>

                <h4 class="font-bold text-indigo-800 mb-2">Try it tonight:</h4>
                <p>Don't just read the words—slow your pace. Add pauses. Let your voice drop to a whisper by the end.</p>

            <p>A preschooler's brain is like a house under construction. The upstairs (logic/reasoning) isn't fully connected to the downstairs (emotion). When they melt down, the stairs are gone.</p>

            <h3>Name It to Tame It</h3>
            <p>Dr. Dan Siegel coining this phrase changed parenting forever. When a child can put a name to the chaos inside, the chaos shrinks.</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Instead of:</strong> "Stop crying, it's just a broken cracker."</li>
                <li><strong>Try:</strong> "You feel disappointed. You really wanted that cracker to be whole."</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Using Stories as Practice</h3>
            <p>In our story "Leo's Lost Roar," Leo feels frustrated. Listening to Leo navigate that frustration <em>while your child is calm</em> builds the neural pathways they need when they are upset.</p>
