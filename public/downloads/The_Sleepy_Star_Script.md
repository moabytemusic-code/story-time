**(0:00 - 0:30) Intro - The Invitation**
*(Sound of gentle night wind and crickets)*
"Hello, my little friend... It is time to rest your busy body... and quiet your busy mind. 
Tonight, we are going to float up... up... up... to visit the Sleepy Star. 
Are you ready? Snuggle in deep... close your eyes... and let’s take a big, deep breath together."
*(Pause for 5 seconds)*

**(0:30 - 2:00) Body Scan - The Heavy Feeling**
"Imagine you are lying on a soft, fluffy cloud. 
Your toes are feeling heavy... so heavy.
Your legs are sinking into the cloud... soft and warm.
Your tummy is soft... rising and falling like a gentle ocean wave.
*(Fade in gentle humming)*
Your arms are heavy... your hands are resting.
Even your eyelids feel heavy... so wonderfully heavy."

**(2:00 - 5:00) The Journey - The Silver Thread**
"Look above you... do you see it? A tiny, twinkling silver light. That is the Sleepy Star.
It is sending a silver thread of light down to you.
It touches your forehead... cool and calm.
This light is magic. It washes away all the wiggles. It washes away all the worries.
It turns everything into a soft, blue glow.
You are safe. You are loved. You are warm."

**(5:00 - 8:00) The Destination - The Star's Lullaby**
"Now, float up along the silver thread... drifting higher and higher.
The air is quiet here. The only sound is the rhythm of the stars breathing.
*In... and out... In... and out...*
The Sleepy Star wraps you in a blanket of stardust.
It whispers to you: 'Rest now. The world is sleeping. You can sleep too.'"

**(8:00 - 9:30) Return & Drift Off**
"Slowly... slowly... drift back down to your bed.
You are heavier now. Sleepier now.
The silver light is still inside you.
Goodnight, my little star. Goodnight... goodnight..."
*(Fade sounds out slowly over 30 seconds)*

**Production Notes:**
*   Leave long pauses between sentences.
*   Do not rush the "Body Scan" section; this is the physiological trigger for sleep.
*   The "In... and out..." section should match a slow breathing rate (4 seconds in, 6 seconds out).
