# Daisy the Daydreamer Dragon (NARRATION SCRIPT)
**Voice: Ms. Erica Clone**

[warm, inviting]
Hello again! It’s Ms. Erica. Today, we’re visiting a place high above the clouds... the Kingdom of Scales. And we’re going to meet a very special dragon named Daisy.

[gentle, whimsical]
Daisy was a beautiful, emerald-green dragon. Most dragons spent their days practicing their "ROARS" or learning how to fly in straight, serious lines. But Daisy? Daisy was a daydreamer. 

[soft, dreamy]
She would watch the clouds turn into shapes of fluffy bunnies... or count the sparkles on a waterfall. Her teacher would say, "Daisy, focus! You need to practice your dragon fire!" But Daisy’s fire wasn't big and scary. It was just a little... shimmer.

[suspenseful but not scary]
One afternoon, the Kingdom of Scales got very, very foggy. A thick, blue mist rolled in, and nobody could see where they were going! All the big, strong dragons were bumping into trees and getting lost in the clouds.

[inspired, bright]
But Daisy didn't get scared. She closed her eyes and used her "Mindful Ears." She listened to the hum of the bees below. She smelled the pine trees near the village. 

[commanding but sweet]
"Follow me!" Daisy called out. She breathed a tiny, shimmering glow from her nose—not a big fire, but a soft, glowing light that cut right through the blue mist.

[proud, warm]
Slowly, all the big dragons followed Daisy’s gentle glow all the way home. They learned that sometimes, being a daydreamer means you see the things everyone else misses. 

[tender, closing]
And remember, my little dragons... it’s okay to have your head in the clouds, as long as your heart is right here with us. I love you! Goodnight.
