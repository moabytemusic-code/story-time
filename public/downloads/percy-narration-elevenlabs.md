# Percy the Puffin’s Polar Picnic (NARRATION SCRIPT)
**Voice: Ms. Erica Voice Clone**

[warm, welcoming tone]
Hello there, my little friends! I’m Ms. Erica, and I am so glad you’re here with me today. Are you ready for an adventure? Today, we’re traveling far, far away... to the very top of the world. 

[slightly mysterious, soft]
In the sparkling, snowy world of the North Pole, lived a very unusual puffin named Percy. Now, most puffins love the cold ocean and the chilly wind... but Percy? Well, Percy was a bit different. Percy loved warmth. 

[affectionate smile in voice]
He wore a tiny, bright yellow scarf, hand-knitted with love by his grandmother. And sometimes, he’d close his eyes and dream of things he’d only seen in his favorite books—like bright tropical flowers and beaches covered in warm, yellow sun.

[energetic, happy]
One morning, Percy’s best friend, Sophie the Seal, flopped onto his ice ledge with a big, wet... SPLASH! 
"Percy!" she barked, her whiskers twitching with excitement. "The Great Northern Lights are putting on a show tonight! We simply HAVE to have a picnic!"

[doubtful, shivering slightly]
Percy pulled his yellow scarf a little tighter. "A picnic, Sophie? Out there? But it’s... it’s freezing! My poor toes feel like ten little icicles already!"

[giggling tone]
Sophie just laughed. "But Percy, that’s the best part! We’ll make it a *Polar* Picnic. We’ll bring all the warmest things we can find to the coldest place in the whole world!"

[thoughtful, building pace]
Percy was a little skeptical... but he did love an adventure. They spent the whole afternoon getting ready. Percy packed a thermos of my very own Special Spiced Cocoa—it smells like cinnamon and big, warm hugs. And Sophie? She brought "Sunshine Sandwiches." They were really salmon and kelp, but she’d cut them into the shape of stars!

[hushed, awe-filled]
When the sun began to dip, painting the sky in violet and gold, they hiked up to Glitter Peak. The wind was howling, and Percy’s knees were knocking together. 
"I don't know, Sophie..." Percy whispered.

[excited whisper]
"Look up, Percy!" Sophie pointed with her flipper.

[magical, slow, amazed]
Suddenly... the sky exploded! Ribbons of emerald green, neon pink, and deep indigo danced across the stars like magical silk. Percy was so mesmerized, he forgot all about being cold. 

[gentle, cozy]
As they sat there, sipping cocoa and eating star-shaped sandwiches under the dancing lights, Percy realized something very important. He didn't need a tropical beach to be warm. He had his yellow scarf, his thermos of cocoa, a sky full of magic... and the very best friend a puffin could ask for.

[tender, meaningful]
"You were right, Sophie," Percy said, his beak glowing orange in the moonlight. "The cold isn't so bad... when you bring your own sunshine."

[warm, closing]
And remember, my friends... you have a little bit of sunshine inside of you, too. Spread it around today! I’ll see you next time for another story. I love you, and goodnight.
