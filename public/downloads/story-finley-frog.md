# Finley the Finicky Frog (NARRATION SCRIPT)
**Voice: Ms. Erica Clone**

[cheerful, bouncy]
Hi everyone! Ms. Erica here. Do you like trying new things? Well, our friend Finley the Frog... he wasn't so sure about that!

[silly, rhythmic]
Finley lived in Lily Pad Lane. He was a bright green frog with very big eyes. And Finley only ate one thing. Can you guess? That’s right... green flies. Green flies for breakfast, green flies for lunch, and green flies for dinner. *Crunch, crunch, crunch.*

[playful, curious]
One day, his friend Barnaby the Turtle brought over a basket of "Purple Lily-Pops." They were glowing and sweet. 
"Try one, Finley!" Barnaby said with a big slow smile.

[nervous, hesitant]
Finley shook his head. "No, thank you! I only like green. Green is safe. Green is... well, green!" 

[pouty voice]
He sat on his log and felt a little bit grumpy. But then... he saw a butterfly. A beautiful, sunset-orange butterfly. It landed on a Purple Lily-Pop and took a tiny sip. The butterfly did a happy loop-de-loop!

[adventurous, building excitement]
Finley took a deep breath. He closed his eyes... stuck out his long, sticky tongue... and *POP!* He tried it.

[amazed, delighted]
"Oh my!" Finley whispered. It tasted like sunshine and grapes! It didn't taste like green at all. It tasted like... a rainbow!

[warm, encouraging]
Finley learned that the world is full of colors and flavors, if you’re just brave enough to take one tiny bite. 

[sweet closing]
Is there something new you can try today? I bet it’s wonderful. I love you! See you next time.
