# The Night-Light Knight (NARRATION SCRIPT)
**Voice: Ms. Erica Clone**

[soft, cozy, bedtime vibe]
Shhh... can you hear that? The stars are coming out. My name is Ms. Erica, and tonight, I want to tell you about a very brave friend of mine named Sir Leo. 

[grand but mini-scale]
Sir Leo wasn't a giant knight with a horse. He was a little boy in blue pajamas. But every night, when the sun went down, he became... The Night-Light Knight!

[hushed, slightly spooky but safe]
Sometimes, at night, the shadows under the bed look a little long. Or the closet door makes a little *creak.* Sir Leo would feel his heart go *thump-thump-thump.*

[brave, determined]
But then, he remembered his "Armor of Light." He reached over and clicked his bedside lamp. *Click!* 

[magical, glowing]
Suddenly, his room was filled with soft, golden stars. He held his stuffed dragon, "Cuddles," and said in a brave, quiet voice: "Shadows are just shapes playing tag! I am the Knight of the Room, and everything is safe and sound."

[peaceful, sleepy]
He realized that he didn't need to be afraid of the dark, because he carried the light right there in his hand—and in his heart. The shadows didn't stand a chance against a Knight who knew how to smile.

[very soft, comforting]
You are a brave knight, too. Close your eyes, breathe in the starlight, and have the sweetest dreams. I love you. Goodnight.
